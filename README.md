# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project - Bellabeat Wellness
##### A capstone project by Jason Qu 
## Introduction 
This capstone project is the final case study of the Google Data Analytics Course provided via Coursera. This case study entails what I have learnt throughout the Google Data Analytics course as well as the application of business concepts and skills that I have learnt during my time in University.

### Bellabeat Wellness
Bellabeat Wellness is a health and wellness brand, designed for women. The company develops wearables and acommpanying products that monitor biometrics and lifestyle data in order to empower women by helping them understand how their bodies work and to make healthier lifestyle choices. Their vision is to ["Empower women to reconnect with themselves"](https://bellabeat.com/about/).

## Business Task & Stakeholders
### Scenario
Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 

### Business Task
I have been asked to analyze smart device data (fitBit dataset) to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices in order to determine an appropriate business strategy and direct focus towards certain Bellabeat products.

### Stakeholders
- Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
- Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
- Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

## About the Data
### Source
Data has been provided by Bellabeat via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) through Amazon Mturk (3rd party source). The dataset contains personal fitness tracking data from 33 fitbit users. Users have consented to submission of personal tracker data for research purposes.

### Storage
I have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle, onto my PC and then stored it into Microsoft SQL servers. Each table is stored in a long format. The data is accessible through SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) by Microsoft.

### Limitations
- The sample size is too small (33) to represent a proper population and will have a high margin of error if used for real world project purposes.
- The dataset does not specify demographic information such as: age, sex, ethnicity, etc...
- The dataset is outdated (2016) for the current date.
- The dataset comes from a 3rd party provider (Amazon Mturk), so there is no way to check validity or bias of surveying methods during the surveying process.
- The metadata is vague. Data pertaining to sleep is not explained how it is collected or how their algorithm functions (Is sleep determined by a user's heart rate or movement? If someone is sedentary, how does it differentiate between a sleeping state and a sedentary state?). Does not specify how steps are tracked, just that they are and that users can also input their steps tracked.
